The program analyzes the data in three different ways. Part 1 is to output the data and compute the top-10 crimes throughout the city of Chicago. Part 2 is to allow the user to analyze the data by community. For a given community, the program outputs the total # of crimes that occured in that community, the percentage this represents of the overall crime in Chicago, the total # of homicides, and then the top-5 crimes for that community. Part 3 allows the user to analyze the data by crime, denoted by entering an IUCR code. For a valid IUCR code, the program outputs the primary and secondary description, the total # of occurences of that crime, the percentage that represents in overall Chicago crime, and a yearly breakdown (total per year).
